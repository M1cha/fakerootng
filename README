This file lists bugs and limitations of fakeroot-ng. There are three lists:
TODO - lists action items that are simply not yet implemented
BUGS - lists functions that are implemented, but have known limitations that
will be addressed soonish
LIMITATIONS - lists limitations either inherent to the technology, or that
are outside the scope of coverage intended in the foreseeable future.

TODO
- Chroot jail support
- Wider support for "old" syscalls (16 bit getuid, 32bit stat etc.)
- Multithreaded debugger

BUGS
- The "wait" type syscalls are only emulated enough to allow two specific
  debuggers to run: fakeroot-ng and strace
- Strace does not support tracing children (i.e. - the -f option)
- Poor handling (race) of redirected syscalls with threaded programs.

LIMITATIONS
- In chroot, the actual interpreter file (ld-linux for ELF executable) will
  be searched for in the real root, rather than in the chrooted jail.
- Program has free access to the fakeroot-ng controlled memory inside the
  program's address space
