Fakeroot-ng allows running a program while lieing to it that it is running with
root privileges. Check out the man page for more details.

Fakeroot-ng basic idea is taken from "fakeroot" (check the AUTHORS file), but
it uses a different technology that will, hopefully, allow it to go where the
original fakeroot has been unable to go. At the moment, however, fakeroot-ng
merely aims to catch up to the functionality fakeroot already provides.

These limitations are limitations inherent to the technology. Work arounds to
some of them is planned, but they are documented here for completness' sake.

Technology Limitations:
- When in a chroot environment, we do not behave like the real thing if the
  interpreter used to run the program (/bin/sh, ld-linux.so etc) does not exist
  inside the chroot. We succeed where a real chroot would have failed.
- It is not possible to run a debugger on a fakerooted process. In particular,
  this means that it is not currently possible to run "strace" inside a
  fakeroot environment.
